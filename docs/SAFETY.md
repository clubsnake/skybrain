# Safety Envelope

- Always test in simulator first (props off).
- LOS, open field, low speed caps for first flights.
- Dual watchdogs: inbound heartbeat, outbound braking detector.
- Sport mode disabled during autonomy (OA reduced/disabled on Mavic Pro).
- RTH altitude = site max height_hint + margin.
